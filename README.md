# Arduino 3.7 - Conditionals II
## For this programming assignment you will use an analog sensor to control output with conditionals. 

### This assignment will use the concepts learned using `analogRead()` and control of the RGB LED from previous assignments.  The conditionals `if()`, `else if()` and `else` will be needed to solve this problem.

### Step One: Build the Circuit

Build your circuit according to this schematic:

### Step Two: Break down the process

The best way to handle a comples task is to break it into parts:
1. Make the RGB LED produce the seven colors of the rainbow (Draw on what you did in the previous assignment).
2. Read the potentiometer with `analogRead()`
3. Review how to use [`if()`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/control-structure/if/), and [`else`](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/structure/control-structure/else/) on the Arduino Reference (else if is a part of these pages).

### Step Three: Put the Code Together

Make sure your prototype behaves correctly. As in the previous assignment, make a new file here on GitHub. Name it 3.7_Conditionals_II.ino and Commit it to the repository. You will just show your working system in class instead of submitting a video.
